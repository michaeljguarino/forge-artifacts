# The following filter verifies that the SNI of the mutual TLS connection is
# identical to the original SNI issued by the client (the SNI used for routing by the SNI proxy).
# The filter prevents the gateway from being deceived by a malicious client: routing to one SNI while
# reporting some other value of SNI. If the original SNI does not match the SNI of the mutual TLS connection,
# the filter will block the connection to the external service.
